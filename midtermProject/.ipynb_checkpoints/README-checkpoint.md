## Machine learning zoomcamp 2024 Midterm project

### Summary
This project is the midterm project for machine learning zoomcamp 2024. Banks provide services such credits cards to customers and would like for customers to stay for the long term. However often time customers leave the bank (`Churn`) and join other banks. It is important that banks analyse customers who could potentially churn and give the better offers to stay with the Bank.
In this project a machine learning approach is use to determine if a bank customer will churn so that customer servive can send the promotions. Different models are trained and different parameter tunes for each model to determine the best parameters. The data is from 3 European countries; France Spain and Germany.
