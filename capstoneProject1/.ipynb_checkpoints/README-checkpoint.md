### Summary
This capstone project of the machine learning zoomcamp 2024. Diamond are precious and determining their price is crucial.
In the price different machine learning models were used to predict the price of a given diamond based on the features of the data describe below. 


### Description of data
The decription of the diamond can be found below
- carat: `weight of the diamond `
- cut: `quality of cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)`
- color: `diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)`
- clarity: `a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))`
- depth: `total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y)`
- table: `width of top of diamond relative to widest point`
- price: `price of diamond in dolars`
- x: `lenght in mm`
- y: `width in mm`
- z: `depth in mm`
